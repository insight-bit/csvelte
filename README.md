# CSvelte -- A compiler written in rust for Svelte

CSvelte (stands for Compiler for Svelte) is a utility to compile Svelte fast and security.

Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app. https://svelte.dev/
